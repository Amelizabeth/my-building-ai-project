# education for everyone
Building AI Course project

## Summary

The project "Education for Everyone" has the expectation to allow everyone, specially the ones who are living in places far from big cities and without or with very less infrastructure to get the chance of a school education.
Education is the key to improve our lives and our communities. Everyone should get access to education. 

## Background

The problem of lack education is very frequent all over the world.
Everyone should get access to education in order to be able to improve their lives and the community where they are living.
Providng people basic education (read, write) will make possible the building of a etter world.  


This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* In small villages far from the big cities infrastructure is missing or very poor (schools, chairs, whiteboard, tv, laptops, other gadgets)
* School children in those poor areas haven't laptops, mobile phones or internet. 
* Often there are no teachers in those small villages. 
* School education should be provided in the local language.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://www.elcomercio.com/files/article_main/uploads/2020/07/29/5f2182ff0619b.jpeg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://www.elcomercio.com/files/article_main/uploads/2020/07/29/5f2182ff0619b.jpeg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
