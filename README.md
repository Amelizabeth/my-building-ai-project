# Education for Everyone
Building AI Course project

## Summary

The project "Education for Everyone" has the expectation to allow everyone, specially the ones who are living in places far from big cities and without or with very less infrastructure to get the chance of a school education.

## Background

The problem of lack education is very frequent all over the world.
Providing people education will make possible to improve life and the communities.

Facts: 
* In small villages far from the big cities infrastructure is very poor or completely missing (schools, chairs, whiteboard, tv, laptops, other gadgets)
* Only few school children in those areas have access to laptops, mobile phones or internet. 
* The Internet signal is very poor or not available at all. 
* Often there are no teachers in those small far villages. 
* The Corona Virus makes the situation worst since children whithout accesst to internet, laptops, mobile phones, etc leave the school and go to work.


## How is it used?


* Creation of a worldwide educational platform (freeware).
* Everyone who can support by the creation of the platform can suscribe and is welcome (Developers, programmers, teachers, etc).
* Creation of an educational programm plan and educational materials templates.
* Lesson and educational material stay available for everyone.
* The worldwide educational platform should allow the teachers to create easily and for free school lessons.  
* School education should be provided in the local language.
* Lessons are prepared by theachers but corrections can be done with help from artificial intelligence (write, read) specially for those cases where interaction teacher-student is not possible.
* Students can access to the lessons live or use a recorded lessons.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
Educational content need to be strictly proof to avoid wrong content (racism, politic tendencies, religios tendencies, etc)
Education for everyone aims to provide basic education for everyone but is not recognized as offical school education. 

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
Education for eveyone should get recognized as official school education.
